# The Buffer Overflow
---

### What is this?
---
I was bored and decided to make a script automate the buffer overflow instead of having
to create a script everytime. No, this isn't what you want or expect but I have used it
on ocassions and it's ok. Also, I use it for fun just to see outputs. IDK, I'm weired.

### How to use it
---
Just run the script to see help. Some commands are the following:

Usage: python bufferoverflow.py <target> <port>

### TODO
---
- Add the option to use content from a .txt file
